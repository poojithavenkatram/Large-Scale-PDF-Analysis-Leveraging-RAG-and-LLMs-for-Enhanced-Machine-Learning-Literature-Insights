        "##### The Super Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Super-RAG) system combines local retrieval with external knowledge augmentation to answer questions with high accuracy and depth. It begins by processing a user query through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which first attempts to retrieve relevant information from an internal FAISS vector database. If the confidence level in the retrieved context is above a certain threshold, this data is sent directly to a small, instruct-following LLM (like LLAMA) to generate an answer. If confidence is low, the system triggers an augmentation step by querying an external knowledge source, such as Perplexity, to gather additional context. This external context is then merged with the retrieved local data to form a comprehensive input for the LLM, allowing it to produce a more complete, accurate answer by dynamically incorporating both local and external information.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### To enhance efficiency, the Super-RAG system includes a cache management layer to reduce redundant operations. When a query is processed, the system first checks the cache to retrieve any precomputed results. If no cached response exists, it generates an embedding for the query, retrieves the closest matches from FAISS, and caches the results for future use. Additionally, the system employs a reranking mechanism based on cosine similarity to ensure the most relevant documents are selected. This reranking function generates embeddings for both the question and retrieved documents, calculates similarity scores, and sorts the results in descending order of confidence. This caching and reranking infrastructure helps optimize response generation, making the Super-RAG system both efficient and adaptive in its knowledge retrieval and augmentation processes."
