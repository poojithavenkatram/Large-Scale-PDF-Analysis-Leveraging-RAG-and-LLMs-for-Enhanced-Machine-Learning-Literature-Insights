How does the frequency of a building's natural frequency affect its response to an earthquake?,"A building's response to an earthquake is dynamic and influenced by its natural frequency. If the ground shakes at the same frequency as the building's natural frequency, it causes resonance, leading to increased amplitude of sway and potential collapse due to the strain on building components.","The frequency of a building's natural frequency affects its response to an earthquake because if the ground shaking is in resonance with the building's natural frequency, it can cause the amplitude of sway to get larger and larger, leading to more strain on the components of the building and potentially causing it to collapse. The natural frequency of a building is the frequency at which it tends to oscillate when subjected to external forces, and it is typically determined by the material and design of the building. If the ground shaking has the same frequency as the building's natural frequency, it can cause the building to vibrate more intensely and for a longer period of time, increasing the risk of damage or collapse.","['1 Introduction \n \nReal earthquake ground motion at a particular build ing site is very complicated. \nThe response of a building to an earthquake is dynamic and for a dynamic \nresponse, the building is subjected to a vibratory shakin g of the base.
