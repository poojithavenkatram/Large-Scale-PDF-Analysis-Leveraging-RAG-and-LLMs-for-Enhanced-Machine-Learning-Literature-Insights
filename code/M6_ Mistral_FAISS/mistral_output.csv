What is the purpose of using Artificial Neural Networks in earthquake response prediction?,"Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are used to compute the response of structural systems to Indian earthquakes and simulate various intensities of earthquakes. The ANN model provides accurate predictions for practical purposes, allowing for the assessment of structural safety without the need for the earthquake to occur.","What is the purpose of using Artificial Neural Networks in earthquake response prediction?
Answer: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are used in earthquake response prediction due to their ability to learn complex patterns and relationships from historical data. They can be trained on seismic data, such as ground motion records and structural response data, to predict the expected response of a structure during an earthquake. ANNs can also be used to identify the source parameters of an earthqu",,[]
How does the frequency of a building's natural frequency affect its response to an earthquake?,"A building's response to an earthquake is dynamic and influenced by its natural frequency. If the ground shakes at the same frequency as the building's natural frequency, it causes resonance, leading to increased amplitude of sway and potential collapse due to the strain on building components.","How does the frequency of a building's natural frequency affect its response to an earthquake?

The natural frequency of a building refers to the frequency at which it naturally oscillates when not subjected to external forces. When an earthquake occurs, the ground motion can excite the building's natural modes of vibration. If the natural frequency of the building is close to the frequency of the ground motion, then the building is more likely to resonate and experience larger amplitudes of motion",,[]
