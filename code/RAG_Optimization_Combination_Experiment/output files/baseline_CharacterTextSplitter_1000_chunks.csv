Abstract 
This paper uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to compute response of 
structural system subject to Indian earthquakes at Chamoli and Uttarkashi 
ground motion data. The system is first trained for a si ngle real earthquake data. 
The trained ANN architecture is then used to simulate e arthquakes with various 
intensities and it was found that the predicted responses given by ANN model 
are accurate for practical purposes. When the ANN is trai ned by a part of the 
ground motion data, it can also identify the responses of the s

6 Conclusions 
 
This paper uses the powerful soft computing technique (Ar tificial Neural Network) 
to compute structural response of single degree of freed om system subject to 
Indian earthquakes at Chamoli and Uttarkashi ground mo tion data. Also this 
technique is used to predict the maximum response corresp onding to various 
time periods. It is shown here that once the training is done then the trained 
architecture may be used to simulate for various intensit y earthquakes, thereby 
showing the responses of the system which depend upon the  structural 
properties (mass and stiffness) of the structure. If the ne twork is trained for 
various time periods of one earthquake and its correspon ding maximum 
responses then the model can predict the maximum respons e directly to the 
corresponding time period for any other earthquake tha t had not been used 
during the training. In this way the safety of 

ound motion may be investigated by diff erent methods. The 
method, that has been used here, is to create a trained  black box containing the 
characteristics of the structure and of the earthquake moti on which can predict 
the dynamic response for any other earthquake for a pa rticular structure.  
 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) have gradually been es tablished as a powerful

and their high tolerance to partially inaccurate data.  ANN has, recently been 
applied to assess damage in structures. Stefano et al.[3]  used probabilistic

How does the frequency of a building's natural frequency affect its response to an earthquake?,"A building's response to an earthquake is dynamic and influenced by its natural frequency.

The trained ANN architecture is then used to simulate e arthquakes with various

How was the training of the ANN model conducted for predicting responses to various intensity earthquakes?,"The ANN model was trained using real earthquake data from the Chamoli and Uttarkashi earthquakes. The training involved using ground motion data to compute structural responses, which were then used to adjust the weights of the ANN for accurate future predictions.","The training process involved feeding ground motion data of earth quakes into the neural network model, and adjusting model parameters to minimize the error between predicted and actual responses.","generate further results. 
 
After training ground acceleration and response data fo r Chamoli earthquake at 
Barkot (NE) for 10 nodes in hidden layer, the weights are stored and they are 
used to predict responses for various intensity earthquakes.  The plot in Fig. 3(a) 
shows response comparison between neural and desired for t he 80% of Chamoli 
earthquake at Barkot (NE) for ω=0.01(maximum response=0.135079m/sec/sec). 
Similarly, the response comparison for 120% Chamoli ear thquake at Barkot (NE) 
for ω=0.5 (Maximum response=0.20260 m/sec/sec) is shown in Fig 3(b). 
 
Next, a part of the ground acceleration is used for the  training and it will be 
shown that the present ANN can predict the whole perio d of the response using 
the trained ANN by the part of the data.  So, the g round acceleration and  response data with Chamoli earthquake is trained for an example with the time 
range 0 to 10.96 sec.(550 data points). Its weights are stored to find the 
response for the time range
