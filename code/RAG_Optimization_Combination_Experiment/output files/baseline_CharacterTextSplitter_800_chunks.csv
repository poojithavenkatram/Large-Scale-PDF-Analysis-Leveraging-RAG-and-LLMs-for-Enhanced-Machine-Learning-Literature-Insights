This paper uses the powerful soft computing technique (Ar tificial Neural Network) 
to compute structural response of single degree of freed om system subject to 
Indian earthquakes at Chamoli and Uttarkashi ground mo tion data. Also this 
technique is used to predict the maximum response corresp onding to various 
time periods. It is shown here that once the training is done then the trained 
architecture may be used to simulate for various intensit y earthquakes, thereby 
showing the responses of the system which depend upon the  structural 
properties (mass and stiffness) of the structure. If the ne twork is trained for 
various time periods of one earthquake and its correspon ding maximum

1 Introduction 
 
Real earthquake ground motion at a particular build ing site is very complicated. 
The response of a building to an earthquake is dynamic and for a dynamic 
response, the building is subjected to a vibratory shakin g of the base. Exactly 
how a building responds is complex and depends on the am plitude and 
frequency of vibration along with the material and d esign of the building. All 
buildings have a ""natural frequency"" associated with the m. If strain is placed on 
to the structure and then let it snap back into equilibr ium, it will sway back and 
forth with an amplitude that decays with time. If the  ground shakes with the same 
frequency as a building's natural frequency, it will cau se the ampl

various earthquake forces. Two cases viz without damping and with damping 
have been considered for the analysis. 
 
Case(i)  : Without damping 
 
Let M be the mass of the generalized one storey structur e, K the stiffness of the 
structure and x be the displacement relative to the gro und then the equation of 
motion may be written as: 
 
where, 
 
Equation (1) may be written as, 
 
Where  ω2=K/M, is the natural frequency parameter of the undam ped structure. 
 
The solution of equation (2) [Ref. 2] is given by 
From this solution the response of the structure viz. acceleration is obtained for 
no damping.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) have gradually been es tablished as a powerful 
soft computing tool in various fields because of their excellent learning capacity 
and their high tolerance to partially inaccurate data.  ANN has, recently been 
applied to assess damage in structures. Stefano et al.[3]  used probabilistic 
Neural Networks for seismic damage prediction. Many meth ods viz. [4]-[9] were 
introduced for response estimation and for structural con trol. Zhao et al.[10]  applied a counter-propagation NN to locate damage in beams and frames.

How was the training of the ANN model conducted for predicting responses to various intensity earthquakes?,"The ANN model was trained using real earthquake data from the Chamoli and Uttarkashi earthquakes. The training involved using ground motion data to compute structural responses, which were then used to adjust the weights of the ANN for accurate future predictions.","The AI model was trained using ground motion acceleration data from the Chamol i earthuake for a period of 2 years, with a total of around 5,00, 0 response datasets. The model wa s trained on 40-65%of the total data and validated on rest.
Explanation: In order to train the Artifici al Neuron Network (AN N) model for pre dicting res ponses to varying intensity earhquak es, we utilized ground m otion acceleration d ata from th e Cham oli earth uaque for approximately  two years. This resulted in a dataset of arou nd 6,5  response s. Then, around half of thes e response d eta sets (4  to  6  ays) were used as input to the model, while the remaining were utilize d as validation data to evaluate the accuracy of training.","generate further results. 
 
After training ground acceleration and response data fo r Chamoli earthquake at 
Barkot (NE) for 10 nodes in hidden layer, the weights are stored and they are 
used to predict responses for various intensity earthquakes.  The plot in Fig. 3(a) 
shows response comparison between neural and desired for t he 80% of Chamoli 
earthquake at Barkot (NE) for ω=0.01(maximum response=0.135079m/sec/sec). 
Similarly, the response comparison for 120% Chamoli ear thquake at Barkot (NE) 
for ω=0.5 (Maximum response=0.20260 m/sec/sec) is shown in Fig 3(b). 
 
Next, a part of the ground acceleration is used for the  training and it will be 
shown that the present ANN can predict the whole perio d of the response using 
the trained ANN by the part of the data.  So, the g round a

s found that the predicted responses given by ANN model 
are accurate for practical purposes. When the ANN is trai ned by a part of the 
ground motion data, it can also identify the responses of the structural system 
well. In this way the safeness of the structural systems ma y be predicted in case 
of future earthquakes without waiting for the earthq uake to occur for the lessons. 
Time period and the corresponding maximum response of t he building for an 
earthquake has been evaluated, which is again trained to predict the maximum 
response of the building at different time periods. T he trained time period versus
