Abstract 
This paper uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to compute response of 
structural system subject to Indian earthquakes at Chamoli and Uttarkashi 
ground motion data. The system is first trained for a si ngle real earthquake data. The trained ANN architecture is then used to simulate e arthquakes with various 
intensities and it was found that the predicted responses given by ANN model 
are accurate for practical purposes. When the ANN is trai ned by a part of the 
ground motion data, it can also identify the responses of the structural system 
well. In this way the safeness of the structural systems ma y be predicted in case 
of future earthquakes without waiting for the earthq uake to occur for the lessons. Time period and the corresponding maximum response of t he building for an 
earthquake has been evaluated, which is again trained to predict the maximum 
response of the building at different time periods. T he trained time period versus 
maximum response ANN model is also tested for real earth quake data of other 
place, which was not used in the training and was found to be in good 
agreement. Keywords : Earthquake, Neural Network, Frequency, Structure, Buil ding. 1 Introduction 
 
Real earthquake ground motion at a particular build ing site is very complicated. The response of a building to an earthquake is dynamic and for a dynamic 
response, the building is subjected to a vibratory shakin g of the base. Exactly 
how a building responds is complex and depends on the am plitude and 
frequency of vibration along with the material and d esign of the building. All 
buildings have a ""natural frequency"" associated with the m. If strain is placed on 
to the structure and then let it snap back into equilibr ium, it will sway back and 
forth with an amplitude that decays with time. If the  ground shakes with the same 
frequency as a building's natural frequency, it will cau se the amplitude of sway to 
get larger and larger such that, the ground shaking is i n resonance with the 
building's natural frequency. This produces the most stra in on the components of 
the building and can quickly cause the building to colla pse. Powerful technique of 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been used to model the problem for one 
storey structure. Among the different types of ANN, the  feedforward, multilayer, 
supervised neural network with error back propagation al gorithm, the BPN [1] is 
the most frequently applied NN model. Dynamic response of a structure to strong 
earthquake ground motion may be investigated by diff erent methods. The 
method, that has been used here, is to create a trained  black box containing the 
characteristics of the structure and of the earthquake moti on which can predict 
the dynamic response for any other earthquake for a pa rticular structure. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) have gradually been es tablished as a powerful 
soft computing tool in various fields because of their excellent learning capacity 
and their high tolerance to partially inaccurate data. ANN has, recently been 
applied to assess damage in structures. Stefano et al.[3]  used probabilistic 
Neural Networks for seismic damage prediction. Many meth ods viz. [4]-[9] were 
introduced for response estimation and for structural con trol. Zhao et al.[10]  applied a counter-propagation NN to locate damage in beams and frames. KuZniar and Waszczyszyn [11] simulated the dynamic response for prefabricated 
building using ANN. Elkordy et al.[12] used a back-propa gation neural network 
with modal shapes in the input layer  to detect the sim ulated damage of 
structures. Muhammad [13] gives certain ANN applications in concrete 
structures. Pandey and Barai [14] detected damage in a bridge truss by applying 
ANN of multilayer perceptron architectures to numericall y simulated data. Some 
studies such as [15]-[17] used artificial neural network f or structural damage 
detection and system identification. In the present paper, the Chamoli earthquake ground acceleration at Barkot (NE) 
and Uttarkashi earthquake ground acceleration recorded a t Barkot (NE and NW)  
have been considered based on the authors' previous stud y [18]. From their 
ground acceleration the responses are computed using the u sual procedure. Then the ground acceleration and the corresponding re sponse are trained using 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with and without damp ing. After training the 
network with one earthquake, the converged weight mat rices are stored. In order 
to show the power of these converged (trained) networ ks other earthquakes are 
used as input to predict the direct response of the structu re without using any 
mathematical analysis of the response prediction. Simi larly, the various time 
periods of one earthquake and its corresponding maximu m responses are 
trained. Then the converged weights are used to predict  the maximum response 
directly to the corresponding time period. Various othe r results related to use of 
these trained networks are discussed for future / other e arthquakes. 2 Artificial Neural Network  
 
Artificial neural systems are present day machines that ha ve great potential to 
improve the quality of our life. Advances have been made in applying such 
systems for problems found difficult for traditional co mputation. A neural network 
is a parallel, distributed information processing structur e consists of processing 
elements called neurons, which are interconnected and u nidirectional signal  channels called connections. The general structure of the network that have 
been used here is given in Fig.1. the structure consists of  three layers : the input 
layer, the hidden layer and the output layer. The i nput layer is made up of one or 
more neurons or processing elements that collectively re present the information 
in a particular pattern of a training set. The hidden  layer also consists of one or 
more neurons. Its purpose is simply to transform the info rmation from the input 
layer to prepare it for the output layer. The outpu t layer, which has one or more 
neurons, uses input from the hidden layer (which is a tr ansformation of the input 
layer) to produce an output value for the entire ne twork. The output is used to 
interpret the training and classification results of the  network. The processing 
elements or neurons are connected to each other by adju stable weights. The 
input/output behaviour of the network changes if the w eights are changed. So, 
the weights of the net may be chosen in such a way so as to achieve a desired 
output. To satisfy this goal, systematic ways of adjustin g the weights have to be 
developed, which are known as training or learning al gorithm. Output Units

The obtained time

in Fig. 7(a). The stored weights were then used to pre dict the response for 
different time periods lying in the same range of 0. 5 to 10 but at different time 
interval of 0.5 for another earthquake such as Uttarkashi  earthquake at Tehri 
(NW), The results are depicted in  Fig. 7(b) showing go od comparison between 
ANN model and desired results. 6 Conclusions 
 
This paper uses the powerful soft computing technique (Ar tificial Neural Network) 
to compute structural response of single degree of freed om system subject to 
Indian earthquakes at Chamoli and Uttarkashi ground mo tion data. Also this 
technique is used to predict the maximum response corresp onding to various 
time periods. It is shown here that once the training is done then the trained 
architecture may be used to simulate for various intensit y earthquakes, thereby 
showing the responses of the system which depend upon the  structural 
properties (mass and stiffness) of the structure. If the ne twork is trained for 
various time periods of one earthquake and its correspon ding maximum 
responses then the model can predict the maximum respons e directly to the 
corresponding time period for any other earthquake tha t had not been used 
during the training. In this way the safety of the str uctural systems may be 
predicted in case of future earthquakes. Acknowledgements  The authors would like to thank Department of Science an d Technology, India for

4 Response Prediction 
 
The basic idea behind the proposed methodology is to pr edict the structural 
response of single degree of freedom system i.e. single storey building subject to 
various earthquake forces. Two cases viz without damping and with damping 
have been considered for the analysis. Case(i)  : Without damping 
 
Let M be the mass of the generalized one storey structur e, K the stiffness of the 
structure and x be the displacement relative to the gro und then the equation of 
motion may be written as: 
 
where, 
 
Equation (1) may be written as, 
 
Where  ω2=K/M, is the natural frequency parameter of the undam ped structure. The solution of equation (2) [Ref. 2] is given by

each time step. Therefore, the whole network consists of o ne input layer, one

For the present study two Indian earthquakes viz. the Chamoli Earthquake (max. ground acceleration =0.16885 m/sec/sec) at Barkot in NE (north–east) direction 
shown in Fig.2(a) and the Uttarkashi earthquake  (maxi mum ground acceleration 
= 0.931 m/sec/sec) at Barkot in NE (north–east) and NW ( north-west) direction 
as given in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) have been considered for  training and testing. Initially, the system without damping is studied and fo r that the ground 
acceleration of Chamoli earthquake at Barkot (NE) was use d to compute the 
response for single storey structure using usual procedure  from Eq.(3). The 
obtained response and the ground acceleration is traine d first for the assumed 
frequency parameters ω=0.5 and ω=0.01 for time range 0 to 14.92 sec.(748 data 
points) for the mentioned earthquake. Simulations have  been done for different 
hidden layer nodes and it was seen that the response re sult is almost same and 
good for 5 to 20 nodes in the hidden layer. However,  10 hidden layer nodes are 
used here to generate further results. After training ground acceleration and response data fo r Chamoli earthquake at 
Barkot (NE) for 10 nodes in hidden layer, the weights are stored and they are 
used to predict responses for various intensity earthquakes. The plot in Fig. 3(a) 
shows response comparison between neural and desired for t he 80% of Chamoli 
earthquake at Barkot (NE) for ω=0.01(maximum response=0.135079m/sec/sec). Similarly, the response comparison for 120% Chamoli ear thquake at Barkot (NE) 
for ω=0.5 (Maximum response=0.20260 m/sec/sec) is shown in Fig 3(b). Next, a part of the ground acceleration is used for the  training and it will be 
shown that the present ANN can predict the whole perio d of the response using 
the trained ANN by the part of the data. So, the g round acceleration and  response data with Chamoli earthquake is trained for an example with the time 
range 0 to 10.96 sec.(550 data points). Its weights are stored to find the 
response for the time range 0 to 14.92 sec. (whole per iod) at different 
percentages of the earthquake in order to test the net work learning for the points 
outside the training set. Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) show the response comparison 
between neural and desired for ω=0.01, (maximum response=0.168849 
m/sec/sec) and for ω=0.5 (maximum response=0.168841 m/sec/sec) at the time 
range 0 to 10.96 sec. The response comparison between neural and desired for 
ω=0.01 with 120% of the earthquake force (maximum respo nse = 0.20260 
m/sec/sec) from the time range 0 to 14.92 sec.(748 data  points) is incorporated 
in Fig. 5(a). It is obtained from the weights of the  trained data for the time range 0 
to 10.96 sec. (550 data points). From the same weights,  neural responses for 
80% of earthquake force, is computed with ω=0.5(maximum response=0.135073 
m/sec/sec), for the time range 0 to 14.92 sec. (748 dat a points) and it is plotted in 
Fig. 5(b). The system with damping is then considered and for this,  first from the ground 
acceleration of Chamoli Earthquake at Barkot (NE), the response is computed 
using Eq.(6). The obtained responses and the ground acc eleration are trained by 
the said ANN model for an example structural system wit h frequency parameter 
ω= 0.68981 and damping = 1.58033. This training was do ne for the total time 
range 0 to 14.92 sec. (748 points, earthquake period). Plot of 100% response 
comparison between neural and desired for Chamoli Eart hquake at barkot (NE) 
is shown in Fig. 6(a). After training ground accelerati on and response data for 
Chamoli Earthquake for various nodes in the hidden l ayer it was confirmed that 
10 nodes are again sufficient for the prediction. So, the weights corresponding to 
10 hidden nodes are stored and they are used to predict  responses for various 
intensity earthquakes. The response for 50% ( ω= 0.68981, damping = 1.58033 
and maximum response = 0.00375 m/sec/sec) of the Chamol i Earthquake at 
Barkot (NE) and its comparison with the desired response are shown in Fig. 6(b). Similarly, the response comparison between neural and desired is shown in Fig. 6(c) ( ω= 0.68981, damping = 1.58033 and maximum response fo r 120% = 
0.00910 m/sec/sec) for 120% of earthquake acceleration. Finally, the Uttarkashi earthquake at Barkot (NW) gro und acceleration is used 
with damping = 0.05, at different time periods ( t =  1/omega) ranging from 0.5 to 
10 with an interval of 0.02 (620 data points) for ev aluating the maximum 
responses corresponding to each time period using Eq. (6) .

The obtained time 
periods and the corresponding responses are trained and t hen the converged 
weights are stored. The comparison between neural and d esired results is shown 
in Fig. 7(a). The stored weights were then used to pre dict the response for 
different time periods lying in the same range of 0. 5 to 10 but at different time 
interval of 0.5 for another earthquake such as Uttarkashi  earthquake at Tehri 
(NW), The results are depicted in  Fig. 7(b) showing go od comparison between 
ANN model and desired results. 6 Conclusions 
 
This paper uses the powerful soft computing technique (Ar tificial Neural Network) 
to compute structural response of single degree of freed om system subject to 
Indian earthquakes at Chamoli and Uttarkashi ground mo tion data. Also this 
technique is used to predict the maximum response corresp onding to various 
time periods. It is shown here that once the training is done then the trained 
architecture may be used to simulate for various intensit y earthquakes, thereby 
showing the responses of the system which depend upon the  structural 
properties (mass and stiffness) of the structure. If the ne twork is trained for 
various time periods of one earthquake and its correspon ding maximum 
responses then the model can predict the maximum respons e directly to the 
corresponding time period for any other earthquake tha t had not been used 
during the training. In this way the safety of the str uctural systems may be 
predicted in case of future earthquakes. Acknowledgements  The authors would like to thank Department of Science an d Technology, India for

Abstract 
This paper uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to compute response of 
structural system subject to Indian earthquakes at Chamoli and Uttarkashi 
ground motion data. The system is first trained for a si ngle real earthquake data. The trained ANN architecture is then used to simulate e arthquakes with various 
intensities and it was found that the predicted responses given by ANN model 
are accurate for practical purposes. When the ANN is trai ned by a part of the 
ground motion data, it can also identify the responses of the structural system 
well. In this way the safeness of the structural systems ma y be predicted in case 
of future earthquakes without waiting for the earthq uake to occur for the lessons. Time period and the corresponding maximum response of t he building for an 
earthquake has been evaluated, which is again trained to predict the maximum 
response of the building at different time periods. T he trained time period versus 
maximum response ANN model is also tested for real earth quake data of other 
place, which was not used in the training and was found to be in good 
agreement. Keywords : Earthquake, Neural Network, Frequency, Structure, Buil ding. 1 Introduction 
 
Real earthquake ground motion at a particular build ing site is very complicated. The response of a building to an earthquake is dynamic and for a dynamic 
response, the building is subjected to a vibratory shakin g of the base. Exactly 
how a building responds is complex and depends on the am plitude and 
frequency of vibration along with the material and d esign of the building. All 
buildings have a ""natural frequency"" associated with the m. If strain is placed on 
to the structure and then let it snap back into equilibr ium, it will sway back and 
forth with an amplitude that decays with time. If the  ground shakes with the same 
frequency as a building's natural frequency, it will cau se the amplitude of sway to 
get larger and larger such that, the ground shaking is i n resonance with the 
building's natural frequency. This produces the most stra in on the components of 
the building and can quickly cause the building to colla pse. Powerful technique of 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been used to model the problem for one 
storey structure. Among the different types of ANN, the  feedforward, multilayer, 
supervised neural network with error back propagation al gorithm, the BPN [1] is 
the most frequently applied NN model. Dynamic response of a structure to strong 
earthquake ground motion may be investigated by diff erent methods. The 
method, that has been used here, is to create a trained  black box containing the 
characteristics of the structure and of the earthquake moti on which can predict 
the dynamic response for any other earthquake for a pa rticular structure. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) have gradually been es tablished as a powerful 
soft computing tool in various fields because of their excellent learning capacity 
and their high tolerance to partially inaccurate data. ANN has, recently been 
applied to assess damage in structures. Stefano et al.[3]  used probabilistic 
Neural Networks for seismic damage prediction. Many meth ods viz. [4]-[9] were 
introduced for response estimation and for structural con trol. Zhao et al.[10]  applied a counter-propagation NN to locate damage in beams and frames. KuZniar and Waszczyszyn [11] simulated the dynamic response for prefabricated 
building using ANN. Elkordy et al.[12] used a back-propa gation neural network 
with modal shapes in the input layer  to detect the sim ulated damage of 
structures. Muhammad [13] gives certain ANN applications in concrete 
structures. Pandey and Barai [14] detected damage in a bridge truss by applying 
ANN of multilayer perceptron architectures to numericall y simulated data. Some 
studies such as [15]-[17] used artificial neural network f or structural damage 
detection and system identification. In the present paper, the Chamoli earthquake ground acceleration at Barkot (NE) 
and Uttarkashi earthquake ground acceleration recorded a t Barkot (NE and NW)  
have been considered based on the authors' previous stud y [18]. From their 
ground acceleration the responses are computed using the u sual procedure. Then the ground acceleration and the corresponding re sponse are trained using 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with and without damp ing. After training the 
network with one earthquake, the converged weight mat rices are stored. In order 
to show the power of these converged (trained) networ ks other earthquakes are 
used as input to predict the direct response of the structu re without using any 
mathematical analysis of the response prediction. Simi larly, the various time 
periods of one earthquake and its corresponding maximu m responses are 
trained. Then the converged weights are used to predict  the maximum response 
directly to the corresponding time period. Various othe r results related to use of 
these trained networks are discussed for future / other e arthquakes. 2 Artificial Neural Network  
 
Artificial neural systems are present day machines that ha ve great potential to 
improve the quality of our life. Advances have been made in applying such 
systems for problems found difficult for traditional co mputation. A neural network 
is a parallel, distributed information processing structur e consists of processing 
elements called neurons, which are interconnected and u nidirectional signal  channels called connections. The general structure of the network that have 
been used here is given in Fig.1. the structure consists of  three layers : the input 
layer, the hidden layer and the output layer. The i nput layer is made up of one or 
more neurons or processing elements that collectively re present the information 
in a particular pattern of a training set. The hidden  layer also consists of one or 
more neurons. Its purpose is simply to transform the info rmation from the input 
layer to prepare it for the output layer. The outpu t layer, which has one or more 
neurons, uses input from the hidden layer (which is a tr ansformation of the input 
layer) to produce an output value for the entire ne twork. The output is used to 
interpret the training and classification results of the  network. The processing 
elements or neurons are connected to each other by adju stable weights. The 
input/output behaviour of the network changes if the w eights are changed. So, 
the weights of the net may be chosen in such a way so as to achieve a desired 
output. To satisfy this goal, systematic ways of adjustin g the weights have to be 
developed, which are known as training or learning al gorithm. Output Units

more neurons or processing elements that collectively re present the information 
in a particular pattern of a training set. The hidden  layer also consists of one or 
more neurons. Its purpose is simply to transform the info rmation from the input 
layer to prepare it for the output layer. The outpu t layer, which has one or more 
neurons, uses input from the hidden layer (which is a tr ansformation of the input 
layer) to produce an output value for the entire ne twork. The output is used to 
interpret the training and classification results of the  network. The processing 
elements or neurons are connected to each other by adju stable weights. The 
input/output behaviour of the network changes if the w eights are changed. So, 
the weights of the net may be chosen in such a way so as to achieve a desired 
output. To satisfy this goal, systematic ways of adjustin g the weights have to be 
developed, which are known as training or learning al gorithm. Output Units

3 Error Back Propagation Training Algorithm (EBPTA)   
 
Here, Error Back Propagation Training algorithm and f eedforward recall with one 
hidden layer has been used. In Fig. 1, Z i, P j and O k are input, hidden and output 
layer respectively. The weights between input and hidd en layers are denoted by 
νji  and the weights between hidden and output layers are  denoted by W kj . The 
procedure may easily be written down for the processing of this algorithm. Given R training pairs  
where Z i (Ix1) are input and d i (Kx1) are desired values for the given inputs, the 
error value is computed as 
for the present neural network as shown in Fig. 1. The error signal terms of the output ( δOk ) and hidden layers ( δPj ) are written 
respectively as, 
Consequently, output layer weights (W kj ) and hidden layer weights ( δji ) are 
adjusted as,

By utilizing this method, the research demonstratesthat once a structure has been trained, it can simulate various intensity earth quakes and predict responses basedon the structual properties of thestructure.

different time periods lying in the same range of 0. 5 to 10 but at different time 
interval of 0.5 for another earthquake such as Uttarkashi  earthquake at Tehri 
(NW), The results are depicted in  Fig. 7(b) showing go od comparison between

This paper uses the powerful soft computing technique (Ar tificial Neural Network) 
to compute structural response of single degree of freed om system subject to 
Indian earthquakes at Chamoli and Uttarkashi ground mo tion data. Also this 
technique is used to predict the maximum response corresp onding to various 
time periods. It is shown here that once the training is done then the trained 
architecture may be used to simulate for various intensit y earthquakes, thereby 
showing the responses of the system which depend upon the  structural 
properties (mass and stiffness) of the structure. If the ne twork is trained for 
various time periods of one earthquake and its correspon ding maximum 
responses then the model can predict the maximum respons e directly to the 
corresponding time period for any other earthquake tha t had not been used 
during the training. In this way the safety of the str uctural systems may be 
predicted in case of future earthquakes. Acknowledgements  The authors would like to thank Department of Science an d Technology, India for
