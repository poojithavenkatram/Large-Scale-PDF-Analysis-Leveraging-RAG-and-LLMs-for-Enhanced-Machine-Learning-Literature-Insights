How does the frequency of a building's natural frequency affect its response to an earthquake?,"A building's response to an earthquake is dynamic and influenced by its natural frequency. If the ground shakes at the same frequency as the building's natural frequency, it causes resonance, leading to increased amplitude of sway and potential collapse due to the strain on building components.",The frequency  of building natural  frequency has a significant impact on its  response  to earth quake. Buildings with higher natural frequencies are more susceptible to damage due to higher amplitude of vibrations during earth q uake event.,"os, T.K. Caug hey, N.F. Hunter,
